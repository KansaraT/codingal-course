        The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the
        Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2
        (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.[3] This region
        includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.
